[Lmax Disruptor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCdGlxBbKU4) by Trisha Gee & Mike Barker.  Using the Disruptor as an example, this talk explains some of the more detailed and less understood areas of concurrency, such as memory barriers and cache coherency. 

[Fastware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxnotgLql0k) by Andrei Alexandrescu.  Teaching how to write fast code, in the context of modern hardware.

[High Performance Trading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM) by Carl Cook.  This talk describes how successful low latency trading systems can be developed in C++, demonstrating common coding techniques used to reduce execution times.

[Compiler Explorer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4) by Matt Godbolt.  Appreciate how hard your compiler works for you.
 
[Performance and Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ri8NnOgIVMc) by Eric Brumer.  Memory is the elephant in the CPU.  This talk will examine the pitfalls of poor memory usage in C and C++, and will offer practical guidance for taking advantage of all the memory a CPU has to offer.

[Computer Architecture, C++, and High Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMvO0Mcq894) by Matt Dziubinski.  This talk considers the properties of code which can make it either friendly -- or hostile -- to a modern microprocessor.

[Low Latency DevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5AAA3_iBTU) by Adam Lenders. Talk about low-latency neteworking, linux and jitter.  

[Microbenchmarking C++ Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czr5dBfs72U) by David Gross. Talk about microbenchmarking C++ code techniques, counting nanoseconds.  

## Code Style Videos

[C++ Seasoning](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Cpp-Seasoning) by Sean Parent.  With the goal of correctness in mind, create simple, clear, and beautiful code. 

[Modern C++](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2014/2-661) by Herb Sutter.  A glimpse into the future of general purpose, performance-intensive, power-friendly, powerful native programming.  Includes one of the best demonstrations of the effects of the prefetch and the memory hierarchy on performance.
