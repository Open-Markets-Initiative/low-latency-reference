## Computation/Architecture Pdfs
 
[C++ Compiler Optimizations](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/latency-reference/blob/master/pdfs/optimizations-in-cpp-compiler.pdf) by Matt Godbolt.  This article introduces some compiler and code generation concepts, and includes examples of a few impressive compiler transformations and optimizations.

[Cpu Memory](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/latency-reference/blob/master/pdfs/cpu-memory.pdf) by Ulrich Drepper.  As CPU cores become both faster and more numerous,the limiting factor for most programs is memory access.

[Lmax Disruptor](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/latency-reference/blob/master/pdfs/lmax-disruptor.pdf) by Martin Thompson et al.  High performance alternative to bounded queues.

[High Frequency Trading](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/latency-reference/blob/master/pdfs/high-frequency-trading.pdf) by Christian Leber et al.  Application specific hardware for accelerating High Frequency Trading applications optimized to achieve the lowest possible latency for interpreting market data feeds and hence enable minimal round-trip times for executing electronic stock trades.

[SeqLocks](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/latency-reference/blob/master/pdfs/seq-locks.pdf) by Hans Boehm.  Seqlocks are an important synchronization mechanism and represent a significant improvement over
conventional reader-writer locks in some contexts
